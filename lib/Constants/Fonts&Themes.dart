    "Budgeting your money is the cornerstone of a sound financial plan, and seeing all the numbers in black and white can offer valuable perspective on where your money is going and where you could put it to better use.A budget can help you spot areas where you're spending more than you realize and can also be set up to allow for the occasional indulgence as well as unforeseen emergencies. You have lots of reasons to set aside a few hours to build a classic budget, especially when you can do it in four practically painless steps.Gather into one place all your electronic or paper bills, receipts, pay stubs, bank statements and any other record of income or expenses for at least a month. Or keep track of monthly income and expenditures as they happen.Create a budget worksheet, using a budget template from Google Sheets, an Excel spreadsheet, or paper and pen. List all your income after taxes — for example, employee and freelance income, investment income, and interest earned on any savings accounts. Then list all expenses — for example, rent or mortgage payments, credit card payments, installment loan payments, grocery receipts and utility bills.Add up each set of figures and subtract the expense total from the income total to get a general picture of your financial health. If your income total is larger than your expense total — congratulations — you just found more money for saving, investing and paying down your debt. If your expense total is larger than your income total, all is not lost, but you'll have to make some choices about where you spend some of your money going forward if you want to balance your budget.Drill down into your expenses and further categorize them into fixed, variable and discretionary expenses. Fixed expenses (such as your rent) remain the same from month to month and thus often constitute the basis of your budget. Variable expenses, such as utility bills, can typically be lowered with behavioral tweaks like turning off the lights as you leave a room, and discretionary expenses consist of wants rather than needs and provide the most opportunities for saving.Adopt the 50-20-30 ApproachYou have alternatives if you don't want to make a classic budget. For example, you could consider structuring your plan according to the 50-20-30 rule. Under this approach to budgeting, you spend:50% of your after-tax income on housing, food and other necessities20% on paying down debt or increasing savings30% on whatever you want — discretionary spendingAlthough this plan is simple, some critics say that it allows too much discretionary spending and doesn't emphasize debt reduction or savings enough.Use AppsAnother alternative to a classic budget is a budget app that can be downloaded to your phone, tablet, or computer. You generally link your app of choice to your checking and credit card accounts, and the app tracks your spending and generates a monthly report by spending category.Budget apps can often be set up to alert you when a payment is coming due, when an account balance is getting too low, or if there's suspicious activity in your account. The cost of most apps ranges from zero to several dollars a month, although some offer free introductory periods so that you can try before you buy.Put Your Budget to WorkOnce you figure out how much money you're spending and where you're in a better position, take the necessary steps to put your financial future front and center.Reduce SpendingStart by cutting spending on items you don't need. For example, do you need a 5 dollar coffee every morning? Could you make do with a smaller, older car? Instead of an expensive vacation, would you be willing to try a stay-at-home vacation (staycation)?These types of choices are very personal, so there's no right or wrong answer. But laying them out on the table can at least help you understand your priorities and some of the options you may not have realized you had for saving money.Get a Handle on Your DebtOne aspect that seems to come with adulthood is accumulating some form of debt. Credit cards, student loans, car loans and mortgage payments are common types of debt. Credit cards and other forms of debt can be an essential part of your financial toolbox because they build your credit history. However, exercise care when using them. Understanding the difference between good debt and bad debt can go a long way toward making sure you use credit wisely and maintain a good credit history.At the same time, you should always look for ways to make your debt less expensive while you're paying it off. Transferring your credit card balances to a card with a 0% APR or refinancing your student loans, for example, could reduce the amount you pay in interest charges and accelerate your debt payoff plans.To build wealth, you have to start somewhere. The ability to save money is essential, but the first step in saving is spending less than you earn. This point may seem obvious, but it's also frequently easier said than done. Fortunately, even if your budget doesn't allow much wiggle room, dozens of ways to save money are available.Reduce Your Tax BurdenNobody likes paying taxes, but they're an important aspect of any financial plan. Even if you don't make much money, you might be surprised to learn how certain tax strategies and decisions can affect your finances.Learning how to minimize the impact of taxes on your finances can ensure that more money is going into your pocket and moving you toward your financial goals. Tax planning includes claiming all the deductions and tax credits you're eligible for, and maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts, such as an employer's 401(k) plan, an IRA, or a Health Savings Account (HSA), as often as possible.Set Up Automatic SavingsOne of the best and most convenient paths toward wealth accumulation is to sign up for automatic savings. Open a savings account and then link your checking account to it so that an affordable, fixed amount is automatically transferred into your savings account every month.Shop Smart and Live FrugallyPlan weekly menus and meal-prepping around inexpensive, nutritious foods, and draw your shopping list directly from these menus. Try to avoid running to the store multiple times a week by designating one day a week as your shopping day. When that day rolls around, take your list to a local discount market and stick to the list.Clip paper coupons to redeem at grocery stores, drugstores, restaurants and more, or try using one of the many available coupon apps to take page flipping and scissors out of the equation.Shop for clothes, furniture and toys at garage sales, thrift stores and vintage shops, but spring for new mattresses, upholstered furniture, swimsuits, underwear, bike helmets, shoes, and the like. Never buy these latter types of items used.Attempt to spend money only when it's really necessary. For example, use your local library for books instead of cluttering up your space with expensive tomes that you'll probably only read once, if at all.Spend Money to Save MoneyThis advice may sound like an oxymoron, but many real-life examples can point the way to you saving some serious bucks. For instance, take your car in for scheduled maintenance, and don't skip your six-month dental cleaning and checkup. These preventive strategies may be painful to your pocket, but deferring maintenance — whether for yourself personally or on items you own — could lead to a lot more pain and expenses down the road.1. Create and stick to a budget.Not only is budgeting one of the top 10 financial goals people set each new year, but it’s also the foundation you should build all other money goals on.That’s because a budget is a plan for what you’ll do with all your money. It’s a plan for what’s coming in (income) and what’s going out (expenses). When you do it every month, you’re giving your money purpose. You’re telling your money where to go so you don’t end up wondering where it went.This is how you’ll gain momentum in every area of your finances. If you’re already budgeting—bravo! If not, get started so you can knock out all your other money goals.2. Build up an emergency fund.Life happens. But you can be prepared for any money problems that come your way if you’ve got money saved up. We’re talking car trouble, medical expenses and busted toilets—some of the worst parts of being an adult. But when you have an emergency fund, you can rest well at night knowing you’re able to stand up against a financial threat without being beaten.Start with the financial goal of having 1,000 dollars in savings. Then, if you have debt, pay it all off (that’s the next goal we’ll dive into). After that, build up a fully funded emergency fund with 3–6 months of expenses.When you’ve got an emergency fund, you’re ready for those “life happens” moments. Instead of living in worry of what could happen next, you’ll be living with confidence.3. Get out of debt.It’s time to get serious about crushing debt. For. Good. Because debt’s good for one thing and one thing only—holding you back. And you don’t have time for that crap. Sure, plenty of people are still living on credit cards and taking out car and student loans, but you don’t want to be like them. And those credit card companies say you they’ve got your best interest in mind. Um, more like the 16.43% interest they’re making off of you.1 Remember: Every payment you make to debt could be cash you’re stacking up toward your other financial goals.It’s time to shout from the rooftops (literally or figuratively): “Debt sucks!” Then live like you mean it! Check out this debt calculator to see just how quickly you can say goodbye to those payments for good.4. Live on less than you make.The best way to get ahead is to stop getting behind. It’s not rocket science. It’s common sense.Getting ahead with your money is possible—and it’s a perfect financial goal to aim for. You just have to start living on less than you make. So, what does that mean and how do you get there?It means you spend less money than you’re paid each month. Then, you can put any money that’s left over toward whatever Baby Step you’re on. The Baby Steps are our proven plan for winning with money. They cover saving, getting out of debt, and building wealth. See how all those things help you get ahead and move forward with your money?5. Spend less and save more.Another way to get ahead is by becoming more intentional about your spending. Budget every month, meal plan, find deals, use coupons, pay cash, and—to be perfectly blunt—learn to say no to stuff you don’t need.Here’s something that can make it easier: When you’ve got custom budget reports (a feature of the premium version of EveryDollar inside a Ramsey+ membership) you’ll get a monthly snapshot of your spending habits. Then you’ll know immediately where to tighten the spending reins so you can line up your money habits with your money goals.6. Save money to pay cash for big items.Being intentional with your money doesn’t mean you can’t ever make big purchases. It just means you need to have a plan for them. Cars, furniture, technology—these things can get expensive. But having dollar bills in hand to pay for these items—in full—is a fabulous financial goal. This puts you in the driver’s seat, steering you toward owning things rather than owing for things.7. Stop living paycheck to paycheck.So, 78% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.2 That means all their money comes in and goes right back out. That might not sound so bad at first. It might sound like a win because they’re able to stay on top of bills, at least. But if all they’re doing is staying on top of that month’s bills, there’s no way to look to the future—because they just can’t afford to save any money yet. Living like this is about as secure as using a parachute made of cotton candy. It won’t hold up or keep you from crashing to the ground.If you’re stuck in this cycle, know you don’t have to stay here. Seriously. Guess what will get you out? Making a plan with your money! Don’t settle for the “not so bad” reaction you might‘ve had to the idea of living paycheck to paycheck. Go for great. You’ll gain security like you’ve never known.8. Pay off your home.Home is where the heart is. It’s also usually your largest monthly expense. We specifically recommend spending 25% or less of your take-home pay to cover your mortgage plus tax, insurance, HOA fees, and private mortgage insurance (PMI).Now, take a moment to imagine getting about 25% of your income back to spread out over your savings account, travel fund, favorite charity, home-improvement bucket list, and retirement account. That’s what happens when you pay off your mortgage. And that’s why this is a fantastic goal. The work is hard, but the payoff is more than worth it.9. Save up funds to help your children pay for college.One of the greatest financial myths of today is that it’s not possible to go to college without going into debt. And it’s one heck of an expensive myth. Because guess what? A debt-free degree isn’t just possible—it’s the only way anyone should go to college.First of all, don’t feel pressured to make or meet this money goal. But if you’re financially able, helping your children pay for college would be an incredible blessing to give them. Whatever you do—never take out a loan or let your kid take out a loan for college. That’s like digging a hole that can take up to 30 freaking years to climb out of. No. Thank. You.10. Live your retirement dreams.As you imagine your golden years, what do you see? Do you want to pack up an RV and see all of America? Read every book on your shelves? Take up a dream hobby you’ve always waited for until you had the time and money to really do it right?No matter what you picture this future looking like, you’ll need money to make it happen. When you stop working, your income goes away. So, having a financial goal in place to replace that paycheck with retirement investments isn’t just nice—it’s necessary!Why Is It Important to Set Financial Goals?If you don’t set goals, things won’t change. You’ll stay right where you are—in the land of wishful thinking. And while that’s a fun place to have some daydreams, it’s no place to live.Financial goals give life and direction to your dreams. Don’t kill your dreams. Instead, set financial goals to help you reach them!How Can You Achieve Your Financial Goals?Write out your goals.We said it once, and we’ll say it again: You won’t put your goals into action if you don’t write them, speak them, see them. So, get to it. Now! If you need help shaping your dreams into real-life goals, get the Ramsey+ Goal Getter’s Guide.Create accountability.Find a trustworthy person to talk through your goals with. This needs to be someone who’ll give you a reality check and encouragement along the way—someone who’ll check in on your progress and cheer on your accomplishments. Having accountability means you don’t leave your dreams on your own shoulders—you pick someone to help you carry the load.Use the 7 Baby Steps to guide your goals.If you look over that list of 10 financial goals, you might feel a little overwhelmed. Where exactly do you start? What comes next when you decide you’re ready to make these goals a reality?Use the 7 Baby Steps we mentioned earlier. Walking this financial journey all the way to retirement is a long and winding road, so you should take one (baby) step at a time.Track your expenses.Remember: A budget gives your financial goals direction by giving your money direction. But you can’t just set it up and leave it alone. That’s like adopting a puppy, telling it not to chew up your shoes, and then leaving for work. That puppy’s going to chew up your shoes. And the rest of your house. That’s what untrained puppies do.You have to stay on top of your spending by tracking your expenses, and that’s super easy when you have the premium version of EveryDollar—exclusively offered in a Ramsey+ membership (which you can test-drive in a free trial!). With Ramsey+, you connect your budget to your bank account, and your transactions stream straight into the app. You just drag and drop them to their right line.Keep your shoes unchewed and your spending in check. Train your puppies and track your expenses.Become more self-aware.Socrates once said, “Know thyself.” And he knows what he’s talking about. While you’re trying to make these financial goals a reality, remember that your greatest cheerleader and opponent, hero and villain is . . . you. So, in this case, listen to Socrates . . . and us!Being more self-aware is one of the top keys to crushing any goal. Know your money weaknesses and set up a plan to avoid or overcome them. Know your money strengths and build on them as you celebrate every victory (big and small).Reevaluate your goals every now and then.Life changes. People change. Goals can change. That’s okay. Don’t abandon a goal just because it’s going to mean hard work. But don’t hold on to an outdated goal just because you don’t want to feel like a failure. Accepting that you’re heading in a different direction than you once thought isn’t failure. It’s actually healthy!Reevaluate your money goals every year, every six months—and maybe every month if you want! Never be afraid to make changes so your goals fit where you are and where you’re going.Make your goals happen.Goal getters, you’ve got this. Seriously. Whether it’s a new year, a new month, or a random day when you’re feeling motivated to change, you can do it. Goals are dreams with work clothes on. So, get them dressed and ready to come true.";
